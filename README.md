Documentation:

A. Instructions for running the project:
   There are two options.
   1. Use this link to the demo that I created to run the project:
      https://darkwings1989-github-io-shelf-dispaly-demo.vercel.app/
   2. Make a build by yourself from Unity.
      a. Open your project in Unity.
      b. Go to File > Build Settings.
      c. Select WebGL as the target platform and click Switch Platform.
      d. Click Build and choose a folder for the WebGL build output (e.g., Build or WebGLBuild).
      e. Unity will generate an HTML file, a Build folder with .js/.wasm files, and a TemplateData folder.

      Then the HTML file, a build folder with .js/.wasm files, and a TemplateData folder need to be uploaded to a server (it can be local, I used vercel.app with the instruction they provided (and it working with GitHub account).
